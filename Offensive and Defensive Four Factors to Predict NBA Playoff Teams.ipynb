    "# Offensive and Defensive Four Factors to Predict NBA Playoff Teams\n",
    "\n",
    "Extending my previous analysis using the offensive four factors introduced by Dean Oliver, I will use both offensive and defensive four factors to determine the best predictors for whether an NBA team will make the playoffs. This analysis will be conducted in a similar manner, using logistic regression to determine which factors can be removed to create a strong but parsimonious model based on the 2018-2019 NBA season. I will then use those factors on the 2017-2018 NBA season to determine whether the model can predict playoff teams well out-of-sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike the previous analysis that was only done in Minitab, I will be conducting this analysis in Python."
